# filesystem
An application that will perform the functions of a file manager.
In terms of functionality, the application should provide the following features:
LIST - scroll through the contents of a folder
INFO - display file / folder information in a transparent format,
Name,
path,
size,
date of creation,
last modified date,
CREATE_DIR - create a folder,
RENAME - rename files / folders,
COPY - copy files / complete folders,
MOVE - move files / complete folders,
DELETE - delete files / folders.

The above commands are used for these operations, respectively.
The user is prompted to choose which of the operations with the file / folder he wants to perform. After the application user enters a specific command into the console, the application displays a message about a recognized command (or not recognized) and proceeds to collect the necessary information.
The user should enter the path to the desired file. Observe the relative and absolute trajectories here.
